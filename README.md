# Fallout4Files

This repository is just a place for me to track some of the Fallout 4 related files I find I need version control for, as I edit them frequently at times. I got tired of forgetting what custom settings I was using in the past, and forgetting what teh original Fallout 4 game folder structure/files used to be before adding mods.  

Specifically, as of 8-25-17, this repo contains:

  1- The original ini (config) files/settings that come with a new install of Fallout 4 prior to modding, (includes folder structure, the main Fallout4.ini, Fallout4Prefs.ini, and my current Fallout4Custom.ini file). 
  2- The default Fallout 4 Folder Structure so I have a way to see what it used to be before I added a hundred mods to it.

Regarding confusion about the "FALLOUT4CUSTOM.INI":

There is SO much confusion online about what, how, and where the Fallout4Custom.ini is exactly. The custom ini file has NEVER been in there, it simply does NOT come with the vanilla game files. But it is easy as heck to make it, Here is what you are suposed to do: 

1) The game does NOT come with a file called Fallout4Custom.ini; it never did! Anyone who talk about the custom ini like it should magiclly "be there" with the default game files, is flat out wrong. If they do have one already, they either added it and forgot, or another mod added it for them (but that is very unusual).  

2. Open the Fallout4.ini in notepad. Click "save-as" and save it as the name Fallout4Custom.ini. DONE! Just make sure it saves to the same folder as the Fallout4.ini, and make sure you do NOT accidently delete the fallout4.ini file. You should end up with both files, one called Fallout4.ini, and another called Fallout4Custom.ini in the same folder, along with Fallout4Prefs.ini or others perhaps. The Fallout 4 game/launcher recognizes this special file name, "Fallout4Custom.ini", and it knows to look there for any settings that are different from the Fallout4.ini, and the settings inside the custom ini wil override the default ini file. Having that special custom ini just gives you a way to make various edits to your settings, without muddying up the original fallout4.ini file. 

To make the Fallout4Custom.ini, open the Fallout4.ini file using notepad or notepad++, etc. Then simply click the "save-as" option, and when it has you give the new file a name, name it Fallout4Custom.ini. Make sure it saves in the same place as the Fallout4.ini file. Bam! You are DONE!
